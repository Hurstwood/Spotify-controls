# Spotify-controls
An AHK (AutoHotKey) scripts that controls Spotify and the global volume controls of the computer.

This script doesn't require the user to navigate to Spotify or the computer's volume controls.


- Play/Pause - *Win+Alt+Up*
- Previous track - *Win+Alt+Left*
- Next track - *Win+Alt+Right*
- Track info - *Win+Alt+Down*

- Volume up - *Win+Alt+Home*
- Volume down - *Win+Alt+End*

- Global volume up - *Win+Alt+Pg Up*
- Global volume down - *Win+Alt+Pg Dn*
- Global mute - *Win+Alt+Enter*




This script definitely works for Windows 10. I'm not sure if it will work for other another OS.


To get this script to work each and every time you start your computer, place the executable in *'..\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp'*. Open run using *Win+R* and open *'shell:common startup'*.
